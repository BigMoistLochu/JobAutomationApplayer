# Job-Automation-Scrapper

### A few words about the project

The project was created for personal use, mainly to apply for intern or junior positions.
Its main task is to gather all job offers from websites like PracujPL or JustJoinIt (in the future, more websites may be added).
Upon the first launch, it collects offers and adds them to a list. Every 10 minutes, a scheduler task runs to check if any new offers have appeared on the specified websites (by default set to Java). If a new offer appears, it will be sent to your Discord (you need to copy the link to your webhook).
